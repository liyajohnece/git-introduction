Here's a fork of Derek Barnes's Responsive: tabs to accordion, this time with a vertical list of tabs on the left!

The tab content box has a min-height applied through jQuery, ensuring it is always at least 50px taller than the tab list.  If the content box expands beyond the minimum, the tab list remains anchored to the upper left side.

When the window width is shrunk, the tabs switch to an accordion.
